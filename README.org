* Background
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsimulation][Microsimulation]] is a form of individual-based stochastic
simulation. In continuous time, microsimulation is closely related to
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_event_simulation][discrete event simulation]], and in discrete time it is closely related
to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model][agent-based models]]. In econometrics and health care,
microsimulation is often used to model policy changes. Our
implementation is in continuous time and uses event-based discrete
event simulation for the model specification.

The package provides several approaches for microsimulation and
event-based, discrete event simulation. The package includes an R
implementation of discrete event simulation, building on several R5
classes. This implementation is useful from a pedagogical perspective,
but it is slow for larger microsimulations. For speed, we also provide
C++ classes for discrete event simulation, building on several well
established libraries, including the [[http://www.inf.usi.ch/carzaniga/ssim/index.html][SSIM]] C++ discrete event
simulation library, the [[http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lecuyer/myftp/streams00/][RngStream]] C library for common random numbers,
the [[http://www.boost.org/][Boost]] libraries for making many C++11 tools available to C++98,
and [[http://www.rcpp.org/][Rcpp]] for providing glue between R, R's C API and C++.

We specifically developed this package for modelling the
cost-effectiveness of cancer screening, where there are many
(e.g. 10^7) individuals who are followed from birth to death. Notably,
we provide a complete prostate cancer screening model, including tools
for cost-effectiveness analysis.
* Installing the microsimulation
+ 1 Dependencies: ::
The microsimulation requires [[http://www.rcpp.org/][Rcpp]] and [[http://www.boost.org/][Boost]]. A convenient, but not
required, way of installing github-packages in R is to use
[[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/README.html][devtools]]. Since both of the dependencies and [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/README.html][devtools]] are available on
[[https://cran.r-project.org/][CRAN]] just run the following in R.
#+BEGIN_SRC R :exports code :eval never
  install.packages("BH")
  install.packages("Rcpp")
  install.packages("devtools")
#+END_SRC

+ 2a Installation with devtools: ::
To install the microsimulation using [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/README.html][devtools]] just run the following in R:
#+BEGIN_SRC R :exports code :eval never
  require(devtools)
  install_github("mclements/microsimulation")
#+END_SRC
+ 2b Alternative installation from shell: ::
# Some thing OS-specific?
If you prefer the shell over [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/README.html][devtools]], just run the following to download the
microsimulation R-package:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell :exports code :eval never
  git clone https://github.com/mclements/microsimulation.git
#+END_SRC

To install the microsimulation R-package run this in your shell:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell :exports code :eval never
  R CMD INSTALL path_to_microsimulation
#+END_SRC

* Running the simulation

#+HEADERS: :var reRunSimulation = 0
#+BEGIN_SRC R :exports none
  require(microsimulation)
  myFile <- file.path("~/Dropbox/microsimulation_runs","README_sim.RData")

  if (reRunSimulation || !file.exists(myFile)){
      sim1 <- callFhcrc(n=1e6, mc.cores=3, screen="screenUptake")
      sim2 <- callFhcrc(n=1e6, mc.cores=3, screen="noScreening")
      save(sim1, sim2, file=myFile)
  } else {
    load(file=myFile)
  }
#+END_SRC
** Available screening scenarios
There are a number of available testing scenarios. They determine
testing frequencies and re-testing intervals over calendar period and
ages.
+ =noScreening= - no screening test, only diagnosis from symptoms
+ =twoYearlyScreen50to70= - two-yearly screening from age 50 to 70
+ =fourYearlyScreen50to70= - four-yearly screening from age 50 to 70
+ =screen50= - one screen at age 50
+ =screen60= - one screen at age 60
+ =screen70= - one screen at age 70
+ =screenUptake= - current testing pattern in Sweden
+ =goteborg= - risk stratified re-screening 2+4 from age 50 to 70
+ =risk_stratified= - risk stratified re-screening 4+8 from age 50 to 70

* Results
** Type of outcome: prevalence, event rates or rate ratios
Some of the more commonly used outcomes are provided through a =plot=
and a =predict= function. The available outcomes are:
+ =prevalence= - proportion of a population in the groups described below
+ =incidence.rate= - rate of /clinical diagnosis/ & /screen initiated diagnosis/
+ =testing.rate= - rate of /screening tests/ (e.g. psa tests)
+ =biopsy.rate= - rate of /clinical diagnostic biopsies/ & /screen initiated biopsies/
+ =metastasis.rate= - rate of natural history transitions to /metastatic/ cancer
+ =pc.mortality.rate= - rate of /cancer deaths/
+ =allcause.mortality.rate= - rate of /cancer deaths/ & /other deaths/
+ =incidence.rr= - rate ratio of /clinical diagnosis/ & /screen initiated diagnosis/
+ =testing.rr= - rate ratio of /screening tests/ (e.g. psa tests)
+ =biopsy.rr= - rate ratio of /clinical diagnostic biopsies/ & /screen initiated biopsies/
+ =metastasis.rr= - rate ratio of natural history transitions to /metastatic/ cancer
+ =pc.mortality.rr= - rate ratio of /cancer deaths/
+ =allcause.mortality.rr= - rate ratio of /cancer deaths/ & /other deaths/
To construct an outcome not listed above you can use the objects in
~sim1$summary~ to construct them.

To simply plot e.g. the /incidence rate/ of the simulated screening
scenario the following line can be used:
#+BEGIN_SRC R :file inst/inc.png :results output graphics :exports both
  plot(sim1, type = "incidence.rate", xlab="Age (years)", xlim=c(40, 90))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:inst/inc.png]]

** Groups in natural and clinical history
The =predict= function returns various outcomes (/rate/, /rate ratios/
or /prevalence/) as described above. It can also be used to predict
outcomes by a number of subgroups. The available subgroups are two
time-scales and four natural history categories:

+ =age= - grouping by single /year of age/ this is the default time-scale
+ =year= - grouping by single /calendar year/ as an alternative time-scale
+ =state= - grouping by /healthy/, /localised/ & /metastatic/
+ =grade= - grouping by /gleason grade/ ~<=6~, ~7~ & ~>=8~
+ =dx= - grouping by /not diagnosed/, /screen diagnosis/ & /clinical diagnosis/
+ =psa= - grouping by psa ~<3~ & ~>=3~

Below is the PSA testing rate by calendar period predicted and
displayed with =ggplot=.
#+BEGIN_SRC R :file inst/psa.png :results output graphics :exports both
  require(ggplot2)
  ggplot(predict(sim1, group = "year", type="testing.rate"),aes(x=year, y=rate)) +
      xlim(1990, 2020) + geom_line() +
      ylab("PSA testing rate") + xlab("Calendar period (years)")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:inst/psa.png]]


The outcomes can also be predicted by several subgroups at once. Plotted
below is the prevalence by age, clinical state and diagnoses. Note
that since this is a natural history of disease model also the
unobserved /not diagnosed/ cancers are predicted.
#+BEGIN_SRC R :file inst/prev.png :results output graphics :exports both
  ggplot(predict(sim1, type = "prevalence", group=c("age", "state", "dx")),
         aes(x=age, y=prevalence*1e5, colour = dx)) + geom_line() +
      ylab("Prevalence (cases per 100,000)") +
      xlab("Age (years)") + facet_grid(. ~ state)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:inst/prev.png]]

** Comparing multiple scenarios
In order to compare multiple screening scenarios the =predict=
function has a second argument for simulation objects. It can be used
to pass a second simulation objects if you which to compare two
screening scenarios or a list of simulation objects for comparing
several screening scenarios. The =type= and =group= argument works as
described earlier. Below is the incidence rate with the /current
uptake/ pattern compared with the hypothetical /no screening/
scenario.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :post commentify(*this*) :results output :exports both :eval never-export
  sim2 <- callFhcrc(n=1e6, mc.cores=3, screen="noScreening")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: #>    user  system elapsed
: #> 106.032   0.660  54.287


#+BEGIN_SRC R :file inst/scen.png :results output graphics :exports both
  ggplot(predict(sim1, sim2, group= "age", type = "incidence.rate"),
            aes(x=age, y=rate, colour = scenario)) + geom_line() + xlim(50, 85) +
      ylab("Incidence rate") + xlab("Age (years)")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:inst/scen.png]]

** Rate ratios and reference scenarios
If you which to investigate e.g. the /prostate cancer mortality rate
ratio/ between the /current uptake pattern/ and the /no screening/
scenarios simply use =pc.mortality.rr= as
=type=. Note that the first argument (expects a simulation object)
will be used for the reference rate against which the rates in the
second argument (expects a simulation object or a list of simulation
objects) will be compared.

When we look at rare events such at prostate cancer death the outcomes
appear a little jumpy due to the stochasticity of the simulation. When
we look at rate ratios this effect will get even more prominent. A
larger simulation would reduce the Monte-Carlo variation, but for now
lets settle with smoothing and focus on the ages with most events.
#+BEGIN_SRC R :file inst/RR.png :results output graphics :exports both
  ggplot(predict(sim2, sim1, group = "age", type = "pc.mortality.rr"),
         aes(x=age, y=rate.ratio, colour = scenario)) +
      geom_smooth(span=5) + xlim(60, 85) +
      ylab("Prostate cancer mortality rate ratio") + xlab("Age (years)")

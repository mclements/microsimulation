* Background
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsimulation][Microsimulation]] is a form of individual-based stochastic
simulation. In continuous time, microsimulation is closely related to
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_event_simulation][discrete event simulation]], and in discrete time it is closely related
to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model][agent-based models]]. In econometrics and health care,
microsimulation is often used to model policy changes. Our
implementation is in continuous time and uses event-based discrete
event simulation for the model specification.

The package provides several approaches for microsimulation and
event-based, discrete event simulation. The package includes an R
implementation of discrete event simulation, building on several R5
classes. This implementation is useful from a pedagogical perspective,
but it is slow for larger microsimulations. For speed, we also provide
C++ classes for discrete event simulation, building on several well
established libraries, including the [[http://www.inf.usi.ch/carzaniga/ssim/index.html][SSIM]] C++ discrete event
simulation library, the [[http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lecuyer/myftp/streams00/][RngStream]] C library for common random numbers,
the [[http://www.boost.org/][Boost]] libraries for making many C++11 tools available to C++98,
and [[http://www.rcpp.org/][Rcpp]] for providing glue between R, R's C API and C++.

We specifically developed this package for modelling the
cost-effectiveness of cancer screening, where there are many
(e.g. 10^7) individuals who are followed from birth to death. Notably,
we provide a complete prostate cancer screening model, including tools
for cost-effectiveness analysis.
* Installing
** Dependencies in R
The microsimulation requires [[http://www.rcpp.org/][Rcpp]] and [[http://www.boost.org/][Boost]]. A convenient, but not
required, way of installing github-packages in R is to use [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/README.html][devtools]]. Since
both of the dependencies and [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/README.html][devtools]] are available on [[https://cran.r-project.org/][CRAN]] just run the
following in =R=.
#+BEGIN_SRC R :eval no :exports code
  install.packages(“BH”)
  install.packages(“Rcpp”)
  install.packages(“devtools”)
#+END_SRC

** Installing the microsimulation with devtools
To install the microsimulation using [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/README.html][devtools]] just run the following in =R=:
#+BEGIN_SRC R :eval no :exports code
  require(devtools)
  install_github("mclements/microsimulation")
#+END_SRC
** Alternative install from shell
# Some thing OS-specific
If you prefer the =shell= over [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/README.html][devtools]] it is just download the
microsimulation R-package by running this in your =shell=:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell :eval no :exports code
  git clone https://github.com/mclements/microsimulation.git
#+END_SRC

To install the microsimulation R-package run this in your =shell=:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell :eval no :exports code
  R CMD INSTALL path_to_microsimulation
#+END_SRC

* Running the simulation

#+HEADERS: :var reRunSimulation = 0
#+BEGIN_SRC R :exports none
  require(microsimulation)
  myFile <- file.path("inst","sim1.RData")

  if (reRunSimulation || !file.exists(myFile)){
      sim1 <- callFhcrc(1e6,mc.cores=3,screen="screenUptake")
      save(sim1, file=myFile)
  } else {
    load(file=myFile)
  }
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC R :eval no :exports code
  require(microsimulation)
  sim1 <- callFhcrc(1e6,mc.cores=3,screen="screenUptake")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:      user  system elapsed
:   179.828   0.188  65.240
* Plotting rates
#+BEGIN_SRC R :file inst/inc.png :results output graphics :exports both
  plot(sim1, ylab="Incidence rate", xlab="Age (years)")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:inst/inc.png]]

#+BEGIN_SRC R :file inst/mort.png :results output graphics :exports both
  plot(sim1, type="cancerdeath", ylab="Cancer specific mortality rate",
       xlab="Age (years)")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:inst/mort.png]]

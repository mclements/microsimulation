Description: Discrete event simulation using both R and C++ (Karlsson et al 2016; <doi:10.1109/eScience.2016.7870915>). The C++ code is adapted from the SSIM library <https://www.inf.usi.ch/carzaniga/ssim/>, allowing for event-oriented simulation. The code includes a SummaryReport class for reporting events and costs by age and other covariates. The C++ code is available as a static library for linking to other packages. A priority queue implementation is given in C++ together with an S3 closure and a reference class implementation. Finally, some tools are provided for cost-effectiveness analysis.
